Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What programming languages does APIWatch handle?
------------------------------------------------

For now, only **Java** and **C**. But adding support for a new language can be done by writing 
an extension. See :doc:`developer/extensions` for more info.

Does APIWatch deal with ABI compatibility issues?
-------------------------------------------------

No, for such needs you should use `ABI Compliance Checker`__
